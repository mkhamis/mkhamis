# SIRIUS Lab Website 

This is the website of our academic research group at the University of Glasgow. 

For those looking to review the publications list, the data is located in '_data/publist.yml' and '_data/crawled_publist.yml'

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. It is based on a [template by the Allan Lab](https://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html).
