This includes personal private data (e.g., in chat conversations) and business-related content (e.g., in emails). Leaking the former might infringe on users&rsquo; privacy, while leaking the latter is considered a breach of the EU&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation as of May 2018. This creates a need for systems that protect sensitive data in public. We introduce EyeSpot, a technique that displays content through a spot that follows the user&rsquo;s gaze while hiding the rest of the screen from an observer&rsquo;s view through overlaid masks. We explore different configurations for EyeSpot in a user study in terms of users&rsquo; reading speed, text comprehension, and perceived workload. While our system is a proof of concept, we identify crystallized masks as a promising design candidate for further evaluation with regard to the security of the system in a shoulder surfing scenario.}, DOI= {10.3390/mti2030045}}

Although gaze has been thoroughly investigated for desktop scenarios, gaze-enabled public displays present new challenges that are unique to this setup. In contrast to desktop settings, public displays (1) cannot afford requiring eye tracker calibration, (2) expect users to interact from different positions, and (3) expect multiple users to interact simultaneously. In this work we discuss these challenges, and explore the design space of gaze-enabled public displays. We conclude by discussing how the current state of research stands wrt.~the identified challenges, and highlight directions for future work.}}

Our research is motivated by the fact that much of the content on public displays includes text. Hence, researchers and practitioners could greatly benefit from users being able to spontaneously interact as well as to implicitly calibrate an eye tracker while simply reading this text. In particular, we adapt Pursuits, a technique that correlates users' eye movements with moving on-screen targets. While prior work used abstract objects or dots as targets, we explore the use of Pursuits with text (read-and-pursue). Thereby we address the challenge that eye movements performed while reading interfere with the pursuit movements. Results from two user studies (N=37) show that Pursuits with text is feasible and can achieve similar accuracy as non text-based pursuit approaches. While calibration is less accurate, it integrates smoothly with reading and allows areas of the display the user is looking at to be identified.}}

With the recent growth of in- terest in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, smart eyewears and low-cost mobile eye trackers, eye-based in- teraction techniques for mobile computing are becoming increasingly important. PETMEI 2016 focuses on the per- vasive eye tracking paradigm as a trailblazer for mobile eye- based interaction to take eye tracking out into the wild, to mobile and pervasive settings. We want to stimulate and explore the creativity of these communities with respect to the implications, key research challenges, and new appli- cations for pervasive eye tracking in ubiquitous computing. The long-term goal is to create a strong interdisciplinary research community linking these fields together and to es- tablish the workshop as the premier forum for research on pervasive eye tracking.}}
